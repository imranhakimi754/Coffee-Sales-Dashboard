# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard

Project Objective:

The project began with a structured walkthrough, outlining objectives and key deliverables. Advanced Excel functions like XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH optimized data retrieval, while formulas such as multiplication for sales and multiple IF statements improved calculations.

Data consistency was ensured through standardized formatting, duplicate removal, and conversion of raw datasets into structured tables. PivotTables and PivotCharts provided dynamic insights, enhanced by interactive elements like slicers and timelines. Regular updates kept data accurate and up to date.

The final dashboard was designed for clarity and usability, integrating visual elements for data-driven decision-making. Optimization techniques improved efficiency, concluding with key takeaways on best practices in data management and visualization.
